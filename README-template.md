## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap]( https://getbootstrap.com/) – CSS Framework


### What I learned

Learnt how Bootstrap Button class used to align all the buttons vertically. Used Bootstrap rounded-circle class giving circle shape to image. I got to learn how in CSS .ttf file is included. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Inter Regular';
    src:url(assets/fonts/static/Inter-Regular.ttf);

}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/button-group/) - This helped me for aligning buttons vertically. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_images.php) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how class shapes the image to a circle. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
